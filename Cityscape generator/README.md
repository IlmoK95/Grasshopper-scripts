Design problem to generate a cityscape:

- My goal was to create a cityscape, in which designer can change the location of different districts, and based on that a city is generated with Grasshopper/ python script
- City being a complex system, to create a script that would capture even most of the relations between different parts is very difficult task
- I focused on a few different relations that affect the cityscape, to make it relatively realistic.
